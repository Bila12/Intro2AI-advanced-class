## Lecture 4 - Zero-shot, Few-shot and Unsupervised Learning
Teacher: Benjamin Devillers (ANITI)


<div style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Very important:</span> due to a strong response in the community, we are splitting the class in 2 sessions. This page is for the <span style="font-weight: bold">advanced</span> session, appropriate for students with prior training in Maths, Engineering and/or Computer Science.
