## Lecture 5 - Object detection and segmentation in computer vision
Teacher: Colin DECOURT (ANITI)

### Contents

* From classification to object detection
* Object detection/segmentation challenges (MS-COCO, Pascal VOC)
* Object detection:
  * Region-based detector vs. single shot detector
  * From R-CNN to Faster R-CNN (architectures, multitask loss, non-max supression)
  * YOLO: an overview
  * More architectures: RetinaNet, R-FCN, SSD  
* Object segmentation  
  * Fully Convolutional Networks
  * U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation 
* Evaluation metrics in object detection/segmentation 
* *Bonus: Mask R-CNN*
