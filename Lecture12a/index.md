## Lecture 12a - Spiking neural networks 
Teacher: Ismail Khalfaoui Hassani (ANITI).

<div style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Very important:</span> due to a strong response in the community, we are splitting the class in 2 sessions. This page is for the <span style="font-weight: bold">advanced</span> session, appropriate for students with prior training in Maths, Engineering and/or Computer Science.
