### Audience
This class, provided by [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/), is intended for a M2-level **audience with no AI or machine learning training, but with some background in Computer Science, Engineering or Maths**. The classes will be in English, and there will be a mixture of lectures and practical work (TP), with at-home assignments. For the practical parts, prior experience with Python programming will be required. 

If you need a refresher on the basics of Python programming before starting our class, you can try [[this course]](https://www.python-course.eu), [[this one]](https://thepythonguru.com/) or [[this one]](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming). 

Similarly, if you'd like to brush up math concepts that are relevant to modern AI, you could check [[this blog]](https://www.edureka.co/blog/mathematics-for-machine-learning/) or [[this one]](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/10/mathematics-behind-machine-learning/), or [[this two-hour video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyxqcS1u5go) or [[this one]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VSZtNYMntM). 

### Registration
Priority is given to M2 students from Universite de Toulouse. The classes are open to other interested participants from ANITI or outside, based on availability. 

To pre-register for the class, **it is mandatory to sign up** with the following form:
#### [Registration form](registration)

Once registered, you will receive the visio-conference links for each class.

### Grading
The class is offered in 2021 as an off-curriculum optional course. There will be no grades and no exams. 

We may deliver a certificate of attendance if you need one; however, this should be mentioned when you register, and in that case we will monitor your attendance, including participation in at-home assignments.
